# wordGuess
This node application is a word guess game. It selects a random word from an array, then allows the user to input their guesses. 



## Objectives

 - Use constructors for the words and the letters guessed.
 - Choose a random word and allow the user to guess the word.
 - Display if the guess was correct or incorrect.
 - Keep track of remaining guesses.
 - Use the inquirer npm package to receive input.
 
## How It Works
When the application is run, it starts by choosing a word from an array and then removing that word from the array so it can't be guessed again. It displays the letter as a series of blanks.Then it asks the user to input a letter. If the letter is correct, it puts the letter in the correct position within the displayed blanks.
